<h1>Hi! I'm Shantai</h1>
<h2>a newbie programmer with a love for computer science</h2>

<p>A lot of times, I find that I need to know the character length of my lines of code.</p>
<p>I decided to stop the Google searches and just make my own.</p>

<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>My Character Counter.</p>
<p>a character counter for your character-counting needs.</p>

<h2>What languages I used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
